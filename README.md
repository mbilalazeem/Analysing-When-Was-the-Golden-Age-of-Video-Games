# Analysing-When-Was-the-Golden-Age-of-Video-Games
### I used joins and set theory to discover the best years for video games!
## Project Description

In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.
My search involved joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I also filtered, grouped, and ordered data. I made sure to brush up on these skills before trying this project!
